Anamnesis
---------
This system was designed to manage memory by handling pointers to all allocated
memory in queues.  These queues may then be freed (and passed around) to ensure
that no memory leaks occur.

There are many systems which do this, many by overriding malloc.  This was
originally written for use in some coursework and as such had to be original, if
not novel.  It works well enough, and offers a large amount of control compared
to a malloc re-implementation.
